# GEO_242_Final
Repository for GEO242 at UC Riverside, fitting a simple plane to earthquake data along the Maacama Fault in northern California.

## Course elements

The course covers various aspects of scientific computing for geoscience graduate students.

-The shell and shell scripting
-Simple data manipulation with awk and sed
-Plotting data and maps using GMT
-Making formatted text documents using LaTeX
-Solving simple inverse problems using MATLAB
-Nonlinear optimization and Markov Chain Monte Carlo

## Final Project

For my final project for GEO 242 at UC Riverside, I write a MATLAB script to fit a plane to seismicity along the Maacama Fault in Northern California. The seismicity used is from the double difference seismicity catalog downloaded from https://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~felixw/NCAeqDD/. The goal of the project was to solve this inverse problem using the least squares method learned in the course.
